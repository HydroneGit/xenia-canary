# Goal

I'm trying to make it so it's easy to edit keyboard mapping in Xenia Canary and possibly later on add mouse input support.

## Installation

It should be as simple as replacing the [winkey folder](https://github.com/HydroneGit/xenia-canary/tree/canary_experimental/src/xenia/hid/winkey) in a clone of the main [xenia-canary repository](https://github.com/xenia-canary/xenia-canary).
